#CS 349 (User Interfaces) at UWaterloo

Repurposed Fotag into a study tool for FINE 282. 

######Changes
- Added a _random image!_ button
- Sort images by year painted
- Round up year painted to the nearest multiple of 5
- Filters by century instead of rating
- All images stored in *a2/images*
- These changes helped in memorizing the title, year and artist of each work
